Fun fact, `griko.id` was my first personal domain and since then has been a staple of my identity everywhere since [**Bulma featured my landing page**](https://bulma.io/expo/#:~:text=1%20Aug%202018-,griko,-6%20Jul%202018).

But as time passes by, the domain felt somewhat boring and informal, especially when my alias email at the time was `hello@griko.id`. Not to mention that I didn't use [G Suite](https://workspace.google.com/) or [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/) for the email address but rather use [ImprovMX](https://improvmx.com/) (then moved to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)) to forward emails to my actual email, which has the caveats of inbox delays and escape hatches to configure sending an email but as another address. So I figured that it's time to find a new domain and use an actual email provider and integrate the domain with it.

I had the idea of having a `firstname@lastname.tld` email address format, but apparently [`nibras.id` is already taken by a muslim fashion store](https://nibras.id/), so I can't use `griko@nibras.id`. Bummer. I also figured that I may drop the Indonesian TLD and use something that's more common or professional but still strikes personal. Had considered `.fyi` but it's too casual, also `.io` and `.sh` is too techy, and definitely not `.wtf`. Also considered `.family` but that might be only applicable for sending emails and not for websites.

So before the year 2022 wraps, my domain and identity is now at [nibras.co](https://nibras.co/) and my new email is at [griko@nibras.co](mailto:griko@nibras.co). All links and emails from previous domain will ~~be forwarded until the domain expires~~ not be forwarded ([read more](/articles/deprecate-and-disconnect)).
