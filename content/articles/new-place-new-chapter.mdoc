I am writing this on my laptop with a makeshift workstation, and today marks the day I moved to my new house. 🏠

Nothing much to say, I guess. Been wanting to draft something for February but there's lots of things to do and things are moving fast, will make a proper post when I have settled in. In the meantime, gonna post this small update then continue cleaning up the house and go IKEA shopping.
