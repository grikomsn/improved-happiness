Currently working as a Senior Product Engineer at ████████████.

Haven't done any open source work this year, planning to resume research and maintenance at [Graz](https://github.com/graz-sh) and other projects.

Family's doing alright. Junior is active as always, and s.o. recently bought a [DJI Osmo Pocket 3](https://www.dji.com/id/osmo-pocket-3) which is neat.

Currently playing [Stacklands](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1948280/Stacklands/). Wanted to continue playing [Gloomwood](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1150760/Gloomwood/) again but can't find the right time. Which also reminds me that I need to play [System Shock](/articles/system-shock-macos) again.
