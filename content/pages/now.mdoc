Currently working as a Frontend Developer at [Skip Protocol](https://skip.money). Maintaining [ibc.fun](https://ibc.fun) on the UI side of things.

Doing some open-source-slash-research at [Graz](https://github.com/graz-sh) and few of my own projects. Planning to ship something before 2023 endsâ€“ if not, early 2024.

Family's doing alright. Junior is active as always, and s.o. is trying new recipes.

Really want to play [Gloomwood](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1150760/Gloomwood/) again but can't find the right time. Which reminds me that I need to play [System Shock](/system-shock-macos) again, too.
